//8. What is the difference before and after you override this method? What does this tell us about methods that are overridden?
//After overriding the method, only the bird constructor uses the overridden method: the original Animal constructor still uses the old method.
//This tells us that if you override a method in a subclass, you can still access the origianal method.
